I love Hadoop! Really, I cannot 
live without Hadoop anymore. In
particular, I love this word 
count example...

Of course, I could count all these
words on my own. But why should I 
do this? I can use the fancy mapper
and reducer files and let them do
all the hard work. Just have to 
figure out how to do it! Let's just
use the word Hadoop a couple of times: 
Hadoop, Hadoop, Hadoop. Wonderful!
